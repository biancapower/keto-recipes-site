       <h1>Cauliflower Pizza</h1>
       <p>Approx. 45 minutes to make.</p>
       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <h3>Cauliflower Dough</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>700g Cauliflower</li>
           <li>75g almond meal</li>
           <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
           <li>30g grated parmesan</li>
           <li>2 eggs</li>
       </ul>
       <h3>Toppings</h3>
       <ul>
           <li>60ml tomato pasta sauce</li>
           <li>60ml pesto</li>
           <li>100g mozarella, thinly sliced</li>
           <li>250g cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
           <li>Baby basil, to serve</li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Instructions</h2>
       <ol>
           <li>Preheat oven to 140°C (fan-forced). Line 2 baking trays with baking paper. For cauli-flour dough, roughly chop cauliflower and place in a food processor. Pulse until very finely chopped, then tip into the centre of a clean Chux cloth. Place over a bowl and squeeze to remove any excess liquid. Spread cauliflower over prepared trays and bake for 15 minutes to dry out. Remove and stand to cool slightly.</li>
           <li>Return cauliflower to food processor with almond meal, oil, parmesan, a pinch each of salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper, and eggs. Whiz until a smooth dough, scraping sides if neccesary.</li>
           <li>Increase oven to 180°C. Spread cauliflower mixture over 1 baking-paper-lined tray to form a circle and use a piece of plastic wrap to press mixture down until about 1cm thick. Roast for 25 minutes or until cooked through and golden, then remove from oven.</li>
           <li>Increase oven to 250°C. Spread tomato sauce and half the pesto over cauliflower pizza base, then top with mozzarella and roast for 5-10 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbling.</li>
           <li>Meanwhile, toss tomatoes and remaining pesto in a bowl. Season with pepper. Remove pizza from oven and top with pesto tomato and basil. Scatter over extra parmesan to serve.</li>
       </ol>

           <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
           <li>2oz cheddar cheese</li>
           <li>10 slices bacon</li>
           <li>1/2 medium red onion, sliced</li>
           <li>2 medium dill pickles, sliced</li>
           <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
           <li>2tbsp low-carb ketchup</li>
           <li>1 tbsp yellow mustard</li>
           <li>2 tbsp unsweetened relish</li>
        </ul>  
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
           <ol>
               <li>Gather and prep all ingredients. Pre-heat oven to 375F.</li>
               <li>On a piece of plastic wrap, lay out the slices of bacon slightly on top of one another.</li>
               <li>Spread the ground beef on top of the bacon. Spread it out thin to ensure it fully cooks. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
               <li>Place the cheddar cheese, sliced red onion, and sliced dill pickles on top of the ground beef closest to you. Make a clean line so it is easy to roll.</li>
               <li>Roll the bacon tightly, enclosing everything inside, using toothpicks to keep it rolled if needed.</li>
               <li>Place the roll on a cookie sheet and bake for 40 minutes or until fully cooked through. While the cheeseburger sushi is cooking, make the dipping sauce. In a bowl combine mayonnaise, ketchup, yellow mustard, and dill pickle relish. Stir this together until it is fully incorporated, and set aside until ready.

            </li>
               <li>When slightly cooled, cut the ‘sushi’ into rolls, one per serving. Serve with the sauce.</li>
