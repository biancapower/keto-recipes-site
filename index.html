    <p> The Ketogenic, or "Keto" diet, is a diet comprised of low-carbohydrate foods.
        The diet focuses on gaining energy from proteins and fats rather than carbohydrates.
        Most keto diets cut back on the most easily digestible carbs, such as sugar, white bread, sugary drinks and pastries.
