        <li>200 g (225 ml) cottage cheese</li>
        <li>1 tbsp (10 g) ground psyllium husk powder</li>
        <li>50 g butter or coconut oil</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Toppings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          50g fresh raspberries or fresh blueberries or fresh strawberries
        </li>
        <li>225 ml heavy whipping cream</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Add eggs, cottage cheese and psyllium husk to a medium size bowl and
          mix together. Let sit for 5-10 minutes to thicken up a bit.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat up butter or oil in a non-stick skillet. Fry the pancakes on
          medium-low heat for 3–4 minutes on each side. Don't make them too big
          or they will be hard to flip.
        </li>
        <li>Add cream to a separate bowl and whip until soft peaks form.</li>
        <li>
          Serve the pancakes with the whipped cream and berries of your choice.

        <h1>Classic Bacon and Eggs</h1>
        <p>Approx. 10 minutes to make.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 eggs</li>
            <li>150g bacon</li>
            <li>Cherry tomatoes</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley, to garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Fry the bacon in a pan on medium high heat until crispy. Put aside on a plate. Leave the rendered fat in the pan.</li>
            <li>Use the same pan to fry the eggs. Place it over medium heat and crack your eggs into the bacon grease. You can also crack them into a measuring cup and carefully pour into the pan to avoid splattering of hot grease.</li>
            <li>Cook the eggs any way you like them. For sunny side up — leave the eggs to fry on one side and cover the pan with a lid to make sure they get cooked on top. For eggs cooked over easy — flip the eggs over after a few minutes and cook for another minute. Cut the cherry tomatoes in half and fry them at the same time.</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
